I've been working with PHP since the late nineties, [just a couple years after the project started](http://php.net/manual/en/history.php). Back then there werent any web frameworks yet and so we wrote simple CMS engines in PHP that would separate content and layout code and reduce  duplication. I then moved on to work with several PHP based frameworks, mostly Drupal and then Wordpress over the last seven years as director of tech for a daily web publication. 

And during those seven years I've been working remotely from my home office. Working from home has a lot of great benefits. Once I grew used to it and figured out how to keep myself accountable and productive, the major downside became clear: lonliness and isolation. I just miss working around and with other people in person. So I started working on a project along with a coworker to help remote workers find interesting people and cool new places to work. We call it [SpareChair](https://sparechair.me).

We worked with the great [Octopus Creative](http://octopuscreative.com) to design and build the first iteration of SpareChair with Ruby on Rails. And so it was clear that I needed to learn Ruby and Rails, and quickly. Enter [Tealeaf Academy](http://gotealeaf.com).

### Finding the right online Ruby bootcamp 

I spent a couple days reading up on the many online Ruby bootcamps available. My main limitation was time. I have a great full time gig and a young family with two kiddos making time for SpareChair quite, well, spare. So I needed something that was self-paced but still made available one-on-one help from teachers and was also agressively challenging with an ambitious goal of providing me with professional quality ruby and rails skills. 

Tealeaf fits these criteria perfectly. I've nearly finished the first lesson focused on learning ruby and introducing ruby in web development with [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/). Everything is self-paced but there are always other students at the same point in the courses as you are. TAs hold office hours every week day and there's a live lession every Saturday morning. You can always find TAs and students in the chatroom and the email-based discussion forum is active and responsive. The wed dev aspects of the coursework so far have been pretty basic, of course, for an experienced web developer, but I'm a ruby noob and so I've focused on picking up ruby syntax and learning how ruby works in a simple MVC framework. 

So far I'm really loving the ruby language. It's expressive and can produce some very lovely, readable code. While I've picked up quite a bit about rails while working on the SpareChair codebase, I'm very much looking forward to starting course two and diving much deeper into rails.
